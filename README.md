# Pymodoro
CLI pomodoro timer with customizable times for working and break lengths.
Pymodoro includes support for graphic and audio notifications.

If you actually want the notification support to work, you need a working notification server:

On Linux you also need the python-gobject package


Note: This program has only been tested on Linux. I'm not sure it will work on Windows. I'm guessing it might, but without the notifications (this includes graphic and audio)

Important: This program ONLY works with python3.
